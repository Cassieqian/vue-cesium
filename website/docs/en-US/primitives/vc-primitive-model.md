## VcPrimitiveModel

Loading a 3D model based on glTF, the runtime asset format for WebGL, OpenGL ES, and OpenGL. It is equivalent to initializing a `Cesium.Model` instance.

Cesium includes support for geometry and materials, glTF animations, and glTF skinning. In addition, individual glTF nodes are pickable with Scene#pick and animatable with Model#getNode. glTF cameras and lights are not currently supported.

An external glTF asset is created with Model.fromGltf. glTF JSON can also be created at runtime and passed to this constructor function. In either case, the Model#readyPromise is resolved when the model is ready to render, i.e., when the external binary, image, and shader files are downloaded and the WebGL resources are created.

### Basic usage

Basic usage of VcPrimitiveGround component.

:::demo Use the `vc-primitive-model` tag to add a model to the viewer and change its lighting.
